## Brief Summary
### Collaborative Metric Learning

- Previous recommendation approaches focused heavily on Collaborative Filtering(CF) methods
    - Matrix Factorization (MF)
        - Factorization of the user-item matrix into dense, lower dimensional latent vectors
        - Prediction based on User-Item Similarity (usually dot-product)
- Metric Learning introduced as an alternative to previous approaches.
    - Interested in learning the metrics among data points
- Limitations
  - Over-simplification of the user-item relations
  - Each user&item represented with a single mapped vector
  - Does not incorporate any item-item relations
<br>

## Hierarchical Latent Relation Modeling for CML
- CML DL Based approach to learn hierarchical relations of user-item over item-item relations based on the following assumption...
  > ***"there exists a hierarchical structure in different relation types, and that user-item relations are built on top of item-item relations"***
